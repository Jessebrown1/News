            Former Real Madrid striker Emmanuel Adebayor has shared an amusing story about his time at the club, revealing how Cristiano Ronaldo's extraordinary professionalism left him astonished.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The Togolese international, who joined Real Madrid on loan from Manchester City in January 2011, was eager to make a strong impression on his new teammates, particularly Ronaldo, whose commitment to excellence was well-documented.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Determined to show his dedication, Adebayor decided to arrive at training two hours early on his second day with the club.
        </p>
        <p>I was told training would start at 10:30, so I made it a point to arrive around 8:30 or 8:45, giving myself at least two hours alone</p>
        <br>
        <p>However, to his surprise, Ronaldo had already beaten him to the training ground by an additional hour and a half.</p>
        <p>I got there around 8:45, feeling proud to be the first to arrive and show my professionalism. But when I asked one of the physios about the noise downstairs, he told me it was Ronaldo swimming</p>
        <br>
        <p>Realising he wasn’t the first after all, Adebayor approached Ronaldo, who casually mentioned he had arrived at 7:30 that morning.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        Adebayor signed a loan deal with Real Madrid on January 25, 2011, for the remainder of the 2010–11 season. During his time with Los Blancos, the striker scored his first goal for the club in the second leg of the Copa del Rey semi-final against Sevilla at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>
                        Following the conclusion of the Spanish season, Adebayor returned to Manchester City but faced challenges, including being omitted from the club’s pre-season tour of the United States. In July 2011, he risked a £300,000 fine for refusing to train with the club’s reserve and youth teams.
